# Usage
I created this script for my student-run business freshman year of college. We needed to send emails to customers. I created this script to automatically send an email when the customers completed their purchase and two follow up emails after a specific duration of time. Since I wasn't a very sophisticated programmer at this time, it has its bugs, and I would definitely make it differently if I were to use it now.
